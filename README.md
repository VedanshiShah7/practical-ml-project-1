# Project 1 Report: Color Calibration Tool
This is a Machine Learning (ML) project with data processing, model training, and an associated website for visualization. The project automates the workflow using a Jupyter Notebook (main.ipynb), which is the easiest way to run the code.

## File Explanations
#### Folders:
- train/, val/, test/: These likely contain datasets for training, validation, and testing.

#### Python Scripts:
- color_extraction.py: Extracts color-related features from images or data.
- data_analysis.py: Performs data exploration and visualization.
- data_preprocessing.py: Cleans and preprocesses the data for ML models.
- model_training.py: Trains the machine learning model.
- object_detection.py: Likely implements object detection if part of the project.
- main.py: A script to run the core functionalities (if not using the notebook).

#### Machine Learning Models:
- model_first.pt, model_second.pt: Trained models stored as PyTorch model weights.

#### Jupyter Notebook:
- main.ipynb: The best way to run the project since it walks through data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation step by step.

#### Website & Visualization Files:
- index.html: The front-end page for the project.
- script.js: JavaScript for interactive elements.
- style.css: Styling for the webpage.

#### Other Files:
- your_data.csv: The dataset used for training.
- images split with train, test and validation 
- README.md: Instructions for the project.
- requirements.txt: Dependencies needed for the project.
